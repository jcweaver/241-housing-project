#### Experiment

**Research Question**: Does implicit bias regarding how majority nonwhite and majority white neighborhoods look affect the perceived value of those neighborhoods?

**Hypothesis**: When presented with otherwise equal-in-value neighborhoods, street view make a respondent more likely to select the white neighborhood as “higher value.”

In order to test our hypothesis, we designed an experiment in which participants:

* Are given information about two very similar properties in different neighborhoods within the same county.
* Asked which property has a higher value.
* Asked how much more the higher value property is worth, in dollars.

Participants in the **control** group are only shown a table of information about the properties and their neighborhoods.

The **treatment** group is shown this table as well as an embedded Google Street View for each of the two neighborhoods.

The street view is intended to serve as a proxy for seeing a neighborhood in person, the way that an appraiser would. We expect that this will be a source of implicit bias.
